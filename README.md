## About

I love creating playlists on spotify but some of the best [Black Metal out there](https://youtu.be/ORzXJs7bhZ4?si=MKr7IMcbjyGO4xbq) is on youtube/bandcamp only... 

I found some online solutions for syncing playlists across services, but they mostly require you to sign up, pay, etc...

So I made this:

This tool facilitates the process of copying the songs from a spotify playlist to a youtube playlist (and any artist + song that you enter in the columns actually...). 
<br><br>
Then you can go crazy and add all the underground shit you want!

## Requirements
- Spotify account (not necessarily Premium)
- Spotify API keys ([instructions here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps))

  _Note: as long as you don't exaggerate, the queries made by this tool should fall under the free Spotify API usage tier..._
- Google account

  _Note: there is no Youtube API key required; it just asks your authorization when running the code, since you will be manipulating your playlists_
  
## Setup
- The simplest way to get started is to make a copy of the [Pre-configured document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnVimrELombuuXrqrq-q2jsN9s5oolMulb7l59rpmu8/copy).

   - And check that the `utils.gs` script is present, and the Youtube Data service is enabled:

- Get your Spotify API client ID and client secret by creating an App in the [Spotify Dev dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps)

- Start using it!

  Set up the URLS, click on `Import Songs from Spotify`, and if you are satisfied with the result, start the migration with `Populate Youtube Playlist`.
 
  _Note: Google will ask you for authorization for running the code and for manipulating playlists with your Youtube account._
